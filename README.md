# ARDL-in-python
When study monthly CPI/PPI data at TF Securities, I realized there wasn't a python package offering a ready-to-use ARDL (Autoregressive distributed lagged) model similar to that in STATA. Therefore I wrote my version of its realization and post it on Github. I will definitely upgrade the file with English notes soon.
